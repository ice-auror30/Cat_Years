# Cat_Years
The first attempt at iOS app programming
This app is just a simple single view application that calculates the cat age by multiplying the number entered by user by 7.
The result is displayed on a label below the text box. There is also a cat image that might not show up on teh screen as I forgot to add the constraints to the image.
Thid is the first of hopefully many iOS applications to come in the future.
